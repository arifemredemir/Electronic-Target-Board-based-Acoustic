# Electronic-Target-Board-based-Acoustic
I designed an electronic target which shows point of shooting that user do on graphical user interface..

## Purpose of Usage
**Why this target board desined?**

  Electronic target systems are cheaper and more useful to use in sports, training and
military fields than automated target systems. In my work on this project: 
preliminary information about the structure of sound, the velocity of propagation of sound
and the types of target system used to day are given. The aim of this project is to determine
the exact point position of the user's shot on the target with the sound sensors Ä± use and to
reflect this position digitally to the user's screen.
In my system, sound sensors, micro-control, target board and one computer are used 
as hardware. The algorithm of the system is written with ardunio and matlab, and the
interface of the user program is written with Matlab App Designer program.
## The Materials
**1. 4 KY-038 sound sensors**
